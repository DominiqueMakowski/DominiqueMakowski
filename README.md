- [**modelbased**](https://github.com/easystats/modelbased): 📈 Estimate effects, contrasts and means based on statistical models
- [**effectsize**](https://github.com/easystats/effectsize): 🐉 Compute and work with indices of effect size and standardized parameters
- [**parameters**](https://github.com/easystats/parameters): 📊 Computation and processing of models' parameters

- [**TruScanEEGpy**](https://github.com/neuropsychology/TruScanEEGpy): Utility functions to work with Deymed's TruScan EEG system

#### Neuropsychology

- [**Neuropsydia**](https://github.com/neuropsychology/Neuropsydia.py): A Python Module for Creating Experiments, Tasks and Questionnaires.
- [**CognitiveControl**](https://github.com/neuropsychology/CognitiveControl): A neuropsychological task measuring different aspects of cognitive control (processing speed, inhibition, conflict resolution...)
- [**RestingState**](https://github.com/neuropsychology/RestingState): Standard resting state protocol with brief mental state assessment
- [**PatientAssessmentApp**](https://github.com/neuropsychology/PatientAssessmentApp): Easy Neuropsychological Assessment of Patients Scores and Deficits


#### Misc
